Query used to select projects

```sql
select u.login, p.name, p.language, count(*)
from projects p, users u, watchers w
where
    p.forked_from is null and
    p.deleted is false and
    w.repo_id = p.id and
    u.id = p.owner_id
group by p.id
having count(*) > 50
order by count(*) desc
```
You can then call the Travis Poker to see whether these projects use Travis CI or not. Projects will be annotated with a binary flag indicating this.

To further process the list generated by Travis Poker, do
```bash
grep "true" results.csv > travis_enabled
sed -i 's/\([^,]*\),\([^,]*\).*/\1 \2/' travis_enabled
```

This list can now be passed to the Traivs Harvester, for which we use parallel.

Retrieve build logs of 20 GH project simultaneously (beware, depending on your network connection this puts a heavy load on Travis-CI!)
```bash
cat travis-enabled | parallel -j 20 --colsep ' ' ruby bin/travis_harvester.rb
```
